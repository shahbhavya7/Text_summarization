    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \\nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \\ntransformation in the African continent. \\n \\nDefending the nation: Our pride \\nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude held by the Indian \\nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \\ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being taken by different agencies'),\n",

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation by 2020, and he assures her that it is a thoughtful question and that he will work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence to achieve competitiveness. The speaker highlights their personal experience of visiting a village in Nagaland, where they saw a prosperous village with empowered village council members making decisions with financial powers. The speaker notes that this model can be replicated across India's 600,000 villages, connecting them physically and electronically to urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, called Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA), which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes healthcare centers, primary to postgraduate level education, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the need to empower villages and rural areas to achieve economic competitiveness and live up to the aspirations of the youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, India. The project aimed to generate employment and create entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, planting, power generation, and food processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products using locally available raw materials. This has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers and enabled them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker believes that the PURA model can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with 7000 such projects needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met over 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They expressed confidence that the nation's agricultural GDP growth can increase by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries, particularly for value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker shared a personal experience from February 24, 2007, when they met a 55-year-old man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he had a radiant smile and a happy state of mind. When asked what he could do for him, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker, emphasizing that he didn't need anything from others, but rather wanted to share his talents and abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A person with physical challenges, despite not needing anything from the speaker, asks to sing in front of them. The person sings beautifully, showing the latent talent that can bloom with a positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by parents, teachers, and others.\n",
      "2. The speaker visits Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. Despite the severe damage and loss, the villagers show courage and resilience, becoming masters of their problems instead of letting them control their lives. The speaker highlights the importance of partnership between the Army, Air Force, state government, and the people in overcoming the disaster's impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with acts of courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author describes their visit to a village that was affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations and interacting with them with smiles. The author also recalls a visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and hospitality of the tribal islanders who took in affected victims as their own, saying \"there is no such thing as an orphanage in Car-Nicobar Islands\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also mentions a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which reflects the resilience and courage of the islanders in the face of adversity. The poem was sung together with the villagers, who exhibited courage and enthusiasm despite having gone through severe suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author concludes by mentioning an address they gave to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. However, the details of this address are not provided in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries with satellite, fiber optic, and wireless networks. The project aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers. The pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students. Additionally, specialists from India's CARE Hospital are providing tele-medicine services to African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from the Indian Prime Minister, discussing several topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker mentions the success of a telemedicine program established by Hyderabad, which provides live consultations to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This program has enabled instant communication between India and Africa, bringing about societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prime Minister then expresses pride in India's defense forces, recalling his visits to the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet. He highlights the bravery and commitment of the troops, who work tirelessly to defend the nation even in challenging circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prime Minister also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces to the safety and security of Indian citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming Indian youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They highlight the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that has been successful in training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the Medak district. The speaker notes that the program has had a positive impact on the students, leading to increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. They also share a personal anecdote about a student leader who was inspired by the program to help her father quit smoking. The speaker concludes that empowering India's youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's future, as they are the most powerful resource.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also pursuing economic growth. The speaker believes that India has made significant progress in the past 60 years and has a strong foundation to become a developed nation before 2020. They encourage the youth to aim high and strive to empower themselves and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also outlines a vision for a developed India 2020 with five key goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution and access to energy and clean water\n",
      "3. Balanced growth of agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education and value systems available to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. India becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a message of hope and optimism, urging citizens to work together to achieve these goals and make India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is outlining a vision for a ideal society, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and free from corruption\n",
      "* Poverty is eradicated, and illiteracy is removed\n",
      "* Crimes against women and children are absent\n",
      "* Everyone feels included and not alienated\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, expresses his gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years.
